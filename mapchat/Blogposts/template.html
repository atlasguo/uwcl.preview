				<h3><i>Description</i></h3>
				<p>
					Visual content analysis is a systematic coding process that analyzes the composition or visual
					elements within a series of representations, interactive or otherwise. Cartography, particularly
					interactive cartography, has only recently utilized visual content analysis to decipher and
					quantify patterns and trends within a sample of maps. Visual content analysis provides a
					systematic means to analyze large datasets of maps to reveal similarities or dissimilarities within.
					Researchers develop and implement a series of codes or variables to evaluate across each map.
					These codes are geared towards particular research questions and draw on established
					frameworks in map design and representation. For example, common codes for static maps
					include the map subject or theme, projection, scale, map type, visual variables, color schemes,
					information density, labeling, and map elements (Kessler and Slocum 2011; White et al. 2017;
					Fish and Calvert forthcoming). Meanwhile, researchers interested in assessing interactive maps
					may code for representation, but also interactive functionality or operators like pan, zoom, or
					popup retrieval capabilities as well as non-functional requirements such as underlying
					technology, support for mobile, and general usability. Visual content analysis can assess both 
					quantitative and qualitative attributes with these codes. The coding process returns numerical
					data that can then be analyzed to detect relationships and correlations. </p>

					<h3><i>Influential Disciplines</i></h3>
					<p>
						Frequently used to analyze texts (i.e. identifying key words, phrases and themes in an interview)
						content analysis has been extended beyond textual analysis to visual analysis (Cope 2011 and
						Rose 2012). As society becomes continually ingrained with visuals, there is an increased demand
						to understand cultural representations. As such, content analysis has been utilized in the fields of
						media studies, cultural studies, social science, usability engineering and to some extent,
						cartography. Media studies, for example, has used content analysis to analyze advertisements
						over time and cultural theorists have utilized content analysis to examine the depiction of women
						in National Geographic Magazine (Krippendorf 1989 and Lutz and Collins 1993). Visualization
						and usability engineers have similarly used content analysis or competitive analysis to explore
						existing standard applications during the first step of the UI/UX design process (Roth et al.
						2015b). While the influences and applications of content analysis are vast, it is important to note
						the differential goals in its usage. Usability engineers, for example, might utilize content analysis
						for quick and practical analysis to inform successful interface design at low cost. Alternatively,
						content analysis in media studies might appraise and critique contemporary visual culture. 
					</p>

					<h3><i>Content Analysis in Cartography</i></h3>
					Content analysis is well-suited for cartographic analysis given the field’s reliance on visual
					representations. Ian Muehlenhaus (2011) recognizes the method as a highly underutilized, yet
					advantageous method for cartography. Several cartographers have used content analysis in their
					scholarly work on static representations. Muehlenhaus (2011 and 2013) has used visual content
					analysis to temporally explore minute changes in thematic map design in Goode’s World Atlas
					editions and to better understand the design and composition of persuasive maps. In the former
					piece, Muehlenhaus provides a detailed methodological account for future work cartographic
					work. Similarly, Slocum and Kessler (2011) historically examine thematic map design in two
					prominent geography journals—Annals of the Association of American Geographers and The
					Geographical Journal. To better understand cartographic conventions and techniques utilized in
					contemporary media, Kelly (2015) combines content and discourse analysis to understand the
					composition and power embedded within maps produced by western media. Kelly (2015)
					demonstrates the effective use of content analysis in combination with additional visual
					methodologies like discourse analysis.<br>
					More and more, visual content analysis has also been incorporated into interactive mapping
					research. Fish and Calvert (forthcoming) have recently utilized content analysis to explore
					alternative energy management and practice in online interactive applications. In their method
					design, Fish and Calvert expand static map design codes like the visual variables (hue, size,
					height, texture, etc.) to interaction design codes like interaction operators (pan, zoom, retrieve,
					sequence, overlay etc.). Roth et al. (2015a) similarly use a competitive analysis or content
					analysis of climate management applications, specifically management applications related to 
					water, to inform early stages of the design process. Parrott et al. (2007) use content analysis to
					examine both static and interactive maps published within state comprehensive cancer plans. To
					further examine interactive functionality, Roth et al. (2015b) use content analysis to examine
					web mapping technology and open web platforms to inform cartographic higher education.

					<h3><i>Materials</i></h3>
					<p>
							Visual content analysis relies on secondary data and not participants. Because of this, sampling
							of visual data is increasingly important. Muehlenhaus (2011) notes that random sampling is the
							best practice. Random sampling, however, is often not realistic because it may not directly
							answer specified research questions. Convenience and selective sampling can then be strategic
							even with their subjective limitations. Both sampling techniques can alleviate time and
							redundancy within a sample. Rose (2012) suggests three additional sampling techniques:
							stratified, systematic, and cluster. The table below defines and details each sampling method.
							The most important consideration, according to Muehlenhaus (2011), is transparency and
							acknowledgement of your sampling methods as well as its advantages and limitations. 
					</p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th><i>Sampling Methods</i></th>
							<th><i>Definition</i></th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Random</td>
							<td>Determine the number of maps needed and then use a random number generator to select final maps (Rose 2012)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Convenience</td>
							<td>Select maps that are easily accessible and readily available (Muehlenhaus 2011)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Selective</td>
							<td>Subjectively select maps based on defined research questions and purpose of study
									(Muehlenhaus 2011)</td>
								
						</tr>
						<tr> 
							<td>Stratified</td>
							<td>Sample from predetermined subgroups (Rose 2012)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Systematic</td>
							<td>Choose maps based on a predetermined interval, every fifth map (Rose 2012)</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Cluster</td>
							<td>Choose groups at random and sample maps from each group (Rose 2012)</td>
						</tr>

					</table><br>
					
					<p>Visual content analysis requires few materials up front. Once a sampling method is determined,
						it is helpful to methodologically collect, back up, and catalogue your data. If working with print
						maps, consider scanning materials for easy access and documentation. If working with online
						static maps or interactive maps, consider taking a screenshot of the webpage or application or
						even better, take a video to demonstrate the maps’ functionality. Create a catalogue or database
						of your collected data and develop a labeling scheme that makes sense for your map sample (i.e.
						source_map1, source_map2, source_map3). After data is methodically collected and organized,
						the actual coding process of content analysis can be conducted using Excel or even pen and
						paper. While perhaps unnecessary and potentially costly, there are online tools available like
						Atlas.ti that aid in qualitative content analysis. Additionally, there are a variety of data analysis
						software packages available for basic descriptive statistics and advanced statistical analysis.
						Overall, computer access is highly advantageous for visual content analysis. </p>

						<h3><i>Procedure</i></h3>
						<p>The first step to a successful visual content analysis is determining research questions. Research
							questions are imperative because they focus the scope of the study and limit visual or interactive 
							elements to be coded within your dataset. The second step is to collect a dataset of maps that
							answers your specific research questions (sampling methods discussed above). Once data is
							collected, the researcher needs to develop a series of codes that will be applied to the dataset.
							Gillian Rose (2012) suggests that codes are extensive, enlightening, and exclusive. In other
							words, coding schemes must be broad enough to answer your research questions as well as
							interesting and purposeful with limited overlap between codes. Furthermore, there are two types
							of codes: descriptive and analytic. Descriptive codes answer “who, what, when, and where”
							questions. Analytical codes are driven from relevant literature and dive into the research
							questions on hand. Because cartographic literature is directly tied to representation, descriptive
							and analytic codes often overlap. Each code needs to be defined and providing visual examples is
							extremely helpful (see example codes below). Next, the researcher applies each code to a small
							portion of the dataset. Going back and forth between the dataset and codes is an iterative process
							and helps refine and detect problems within the codes. Codes can then be edited, deleted or
							added to as needed. Once finalized, the codes are then applied to each map in the dataset. This
							process can be time consuming and requires focus. It is also beneficial to have more than oneperson code the data. Slocum and Kessler (2011) recommend extensive training on the codes and
							their definitions for anyone involved the coding process. Once coded, the data can then be
							analyzed to better understand the frequency of visual elements and trends within a dataset.</p>

							<h3><i>Data Qualities/Measures</i></h3>
							<p>Content analysis can be both quantitative and qualitative in nature; see Muehlenhaus 2011 for
									more on quantitative content analysis and Rose 2012 for qualitative content analysis.
									Quantitative content analysis is useful for a large amount of source materials because it reduces
									data to particular themes sought by the research question (Cope 2010). Quantitative content
									analysis assesses binary information. For example, can the user pan the map: yes, or no?
									Qualitative content analysis in contrast introduces some subjectivity on behalf of the researcher
									or coder. A qualitative approach to content analysis critically examines analytic codes and is
									concerned with drawing relationships between maps as opposed to drawing statistical results.
									Information density in an interactive map, for example, could be assessed on a Likert scale (i.e.
									none, low, medium and high information density) where each level of information density would
									be already defined. Slocum and Kessler (2011) subjectively score (1–10 scale) each map in their
									dataset based on overall map design. The goal of a qualitative content analysis is less reliant on
									strict numeric relationships and more interested in overall themes and patterns. While complete
									replicability is impossible, clearly defining and strictly applying codes is important for both
									qualitative and quantitative codes. </p>

								<h3><i>Analysis</i></h3>
									<p>The final step of visual content analysis is the actual analysis of coded data. Descriptive statistics
											such as frequency and percentages (i.e. how many/what percent of interactive maps included pan
											or zoom) or averaged Likert scores (i.e. what was the average level of information density in the
											series of maps). Descriptive statistics provide easily accessible and valuable insight to your
											dataset. These measures allow for quick assessment of overall trends in your data and can help
											determine variables that were not relevant and can be removed. One of the strengths of visual
											content analysis its ability to examine and compare relationships between coded variables.
											Muehlenhaus (2011), for example, uses cross-tabulations to identify relationship between coded
											variables. Advanced statistics (Chi-square testing, multivariate analysis, cluster analysis, gamma 
											statistics) can also be used to determined correlations and causation between coded variables
											(Kessler and Slocum 2011). </p>
