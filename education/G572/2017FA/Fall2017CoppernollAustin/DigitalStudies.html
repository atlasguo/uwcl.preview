					<p class="digitalstudiestop"> Paramount to my work as a cartographer and GIS developer has been my contributions to a variety of other projects rooted within the basis of my Digital Studies certificate.  My wide exposure to all kinds of digital technology over the course of my college career has allowed for me to develop a sort of technical fluency that makes it easy for me to quickly grasp concepts relating to the use of said technology.  I have worked with many software programs over the past four years including consistent use of the Adobe Creative and Microsoft Office Suites and ESRI products. This has also led to gradual experience in analysis through the manipulation of spatial databases and scripting based primarily in Javascript, Python, HTML/CSS, and SQL. </p>
		
					<p class="digitalstudies">I have at my disposal a sort of grab bag of knowledge that can be readily applied toward many situations so as to be able to meet deadlines even in the face of a potential challenge stemming from a technical process I am unfamiliar with. Although my proficiency with any one software program or programming language may vary, the fundamental basis of my tightly-organized workflow remains the same so that I am able to consistently deliver results that I feel are emblematic of my very best efforts and that reach above and beyond any initial expectations. </p>
		
					<p class="digitalstudies">Below you can see some of the work I have produced that contrasts from the cartographic projects exhibited on other parts of this site.  There are, however, many aspects of my education through the certificate that I simply can't replicate in a visible, digital format that make up my well-rounded composition as a Digital Studies student. </p>

					<p class="digitalstudies">I produced this for a media production course where we were tasked with creating a poster using Photoshop and an original portrait photo to promote a non-existent television show where the tone and potential narrative could be deduced from the visual cues present in the poster.  There is much room for improvement as this was in the relatively early stages of my experiences with Photoshop, but it is the most recent full-scale, original graphic that I've created using Photoshop.  Most of my work in Photoshop nowadays is for small touches to cartographic projects and scripted photo processing. </p>

					<p class="digitalstudies">Using the play button below you will enable playback of a podcast I created with a groupmate in a media production course where the goal of the assignment was to create a topical podcast that ran at least five minutes in length and included audio cues and music alongside voices to create a "tangible" setting through sound.  It would be fun to revisit the "Badger Blitz" podcast again someday, and part of the fun of being a Digital Studies student is having the technical ability to expand and improve upon past works when time allows for it. </p>

					<p class="digitalstudies">This video holds near and dear to my heart as the issue of homelessness is one of which I have a great deal of personal investment in.  I've since become well-acquainted with Karla Thennes, the director of Porchlight, who is featured in the video.  Although production was limited by several factors including having to work with insufficient equipment, weather conditions lessening the chances of capturing appropriate B-roll footage, and the very short time frame we had to film and edit the final product, I'm ultimately satisfied with the message it carried by way of continuing an important, ongoing discussion.   </p>

					<p class="digitalstudies">Below I've embedded three Youtube videos, each corresponding to a Youtube channel that I own.  The first video is a mini documentary I made in high school to promote the new local alternative high school that I produced as the video journalist for the school's online newspaper, the Eagle Post.  The second video is of what I believe to be the best trailer I've edited for my personal Youtube channel. </p> 
					
					<p class="digitalstudies">I tend to edit my own version of trailers together with different music in my spare time when the creativtiy for it sparks up.  The final video is of an "ambient mix" from my Ambient Film Tracks channel wherein I've produced several mixes of ambient selections from popular movie scores for the auditory entertainment of cinephiles such as myself.  The channel has become relatively successful with nearly 800 subscribers and almost 48,000 views on the particular linked mix, which has been the channel's most popular.  Feel free to click on the Youtube button in the bottom-right corner of each video to visit the corresponding channel and check out related videos. </p>
