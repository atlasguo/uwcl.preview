						Preface
					</h1></strong>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						The following is an atlas of maps based around the theme of addressing safety on the UW-Madison campus.  My interest in the project stemmed from wanting to pursue a topic surrounding “mapping the unseen” or rather creating a cartographic representation of a phenomenon not physically visible to an individual.  By examining campus safety from three unique perspectives I hope to uncover several questions and maybe a couple answers relating to trends in campus safety.
					</p>
					<h1 class="atlasheader"><strong>
						Perceived Safety
					</h1></strong>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						When discussing perceived safety, what I mean in terms of ‘perceived’ features is any official features established by the institution that harness the potential and intent of shaping an individual’s perceptions of vulnerability in a positive way.  For the purposes of the map below, this includes all of the perceived safety features officially listed on the UW Police Department’s website:  the UW Lightway, SAFE Walk, police patrol presence, and emergency call boxes.  All thematic line features cover the southern boundary of the perceived safety feature it refers to.  The UW Department of Transportation defines the lightway as “a pedestrian level lighting marked by yellow reflective stickers…[with] appropriate lighting for late-night pedestrian travel”.  SAFE Walk services entail several student members who are employed to wait for phone calls from individuals who have to walk somewhere alone between the hours of 7PM and 1AM and wish to be accompanied by another individual.  Police patrol presence is relayed by the blue and red boundary line that traces out the southern boundary of the UW Police Department patrol area where presence is most concentrated.  
					</p>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						This border doubles as the campus boundary in all three maps below as a strict visual outline of the actual campus boundary does not exist.  Finally, emergency call boxes are dispersed across campus where individuals can instantly get in contact with the UW Police Department merely by the push of a button.  It had been my intention to include a dataset representative of street lighting as the presence (or lack thereof) of street lighting has been proven to have a significant impact on safety perceptions, but such a dataset for the city of Madison does not seem to exist.  For this map, it is important to focus on where perceived safety features are most concentrated to compare to the following two maps and see if the features are concentrated where they should be based on feelings of vulnerability and crime data.  It should also be noted that the majority of these safety features fall strictly within the campus/police boundary with an abrupt cutoff along the border particularly in relation to call boxes that proves most troublesome for individuals who find themselves traveling through or living in areas just barely off campus.

						Actual Safety
					</h1></strong>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						For mapping actual safety, crime data was collected from the CrimeReports.com data portal that the UW Police Department specifically links to on their website.  Only violent, person-on-person criminal incidents officially reported on the site between the dates of October 4th and December 4th, 2017 were considered for inclusion in the map below.  The event log provided to the public by the UW Police Department that covered all reported incidents responded to by the department over the same time period was used to supplement the crimes officially reported by the department in CrimeReports.  The map below is covered by “crime bubbles” highlighting clusters of violent crime incidents.  The bubbles vary by size, color, and symbol type.  For size, the smallest bubbles represent a single criminal incident.  The next size up covers an area where two violent incidents occurred over the two-month period.  The largest size accounts for a cluster of four or more incidents in the same area and in this case the only two of this size were concentrated around the 500 block of State Street and the 100 block of East Mifflin Street near the Children’s Museum.  For color, the bubbles with a white circle and black symbol represent crimes that were officially reported by the department on CrimeReports and bubbles with a black circle and white symbol represent crimes that were only found in the incident log.    
					</p>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						Lastly, for symbol type, a fist symbol is used for an assault or battery (majority of the incidents), a mask is used for abduction, a broken home is used for domestic violence, and a broken capital R is used for sexual assault.  Only one of each of the non-battery crimes occurred over the two-month period, but it’s still important to include these incidents on the map for the sake of full transparency and providing a complete representation of crime on campus.  In digging through the incident log I was hoping to shed light on the question of whether crime really doesn’t occur all that often on campus or if students just don’t hear about it all that often.  The incident log’s additions to the map raise questions surrounding why these crimes weren’t officially reported in the CrimeReports website despite having occurred several days prior.  Focus on this map should be drawn toward the concentration of violent criminal activity on and within the immediate proximity of campus.  Of particular interest is the worrisome uptick in crime along the isthmus up toward the capitol that peaks almost immediately after passing through the campus boundary to the East.

						Actual Safety
					</h1></strong>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						With the final map below we arrive at the question, where do individuals that frequent the UW-Madison campus actually feel least safe/most vulnerable?  To construct the heat visualization used as the basis of the map, a Qualtrics survey was distributed to a wide variety of willing participants who voluntarily opted to provide their input regarding where they feel least safe both on and near campus.  The survey consisted of 4 images that covered the entirety of the extent shown in the map below where respondents were asked to indicate the 3 areas they felt least safe in each image.  If the respondent didn’t feel unsafe in the particular area depicted in the image, they had the option to not click anywhere for that image and so with four images and up to three selection options for each, every respondent had the opportunity to provide between zero and twelve areas that they feel unsafe when walking alone on campus.  There was also an opportunity at the end of the survey for respondents to specify in text where they feel unsafe and why.      
					</p>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						In total, 169 unique placement points from 35 respondents were digitized in ArcMap and a kernel density tool was then run using the digitized points to uncover areas of high concentration in terms of locations specified by respondents where they feel unsafe.  The heat visualization produced by the tool reveals that the highest concentrations of points were based along lakeshore pathways and areas surrounding State Street.  Just to elaborate on a few highlights, of the 169 points placed by respondents, 36 were placed along lakeshore pathways, 28 were placed along State Street (including 13 placed in the same area on the far Eastern end of State Street where the street meets the capitol), and 20 were placed in and around Picnic Point.  87 of the 169 points were placed within the boundary of (on) campus and the remaining 82 were placed in areas outside of the campus boundary.  When examining this map, particular focus should be drawn toward areas both on and off campus covered in deep red shading while pondering possible reasons as to why feelings of vulnerability are highest in these areas.

						Bringing it All Together
					</h1></strong>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						What this map atlas provides is an overarching narrative covering varied aspects of safety as it pertains to the UW-Madison campus.  Criminal incidence, institutional safety features, and feelings regarding safety all interact in interesting ways that wound up offering more questions than they answered and the final product introduces a compelling curiosity behind the dynamics of the campus environment that stir potential points of concern.  For starters, it was interesting to find by way of the survey that despite heavy concentrations of perceived safety features that should reinforce individual comfort in concentrated areas on campus, individuals don’t consistently feel more safe in their presence.  Yet despite that, the concentration of safety features implemented on campus appears to at least have a hand in warding off significant criminal activity to areas just slightly East of the boundary.  Poor lighting (often in relation to lakeshore pathways) was commonly cited as being a point of discomfort in the survey for areas where respondents indicated feeling unsafe.  Despite being a part of campus, lakeshore pathways exhibit a significant absence of perceived safety features that could potentially reassure individuals in these areas; particularly leading up toward Picnic Point.  Despite being a popular locale for students, faculty, and campus visitors, Picnic Point still remains as a point of concern in terms of individuals feeling uncomfortable when passing through the area.  In addition to poor lighting, heavy presence of homeless individuals was cited as a point of concern by a few respondents.  A lot of points built up around Veteran’s Park next to the Wisconsin Veteran’s Museum on the far end of State Street by the capitol where homeless individuals frequently reside.  
      
					</p>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						The concentration of homeless individuals along State Street is almost impossible to not notice and the numbers only appear to be increasing with time.  It would be interesting to investigate further whether the homeless situation along the isthmus has any impact on feelings of safety surrounding the area.  The correlation between feelings of unease and vulnerability and criminal activity just East of the campus boundary is also significant.  As is apparent between the perspective and actual safety maps, the volume of crime particularly in the area leading up the isthmus toward the capitol likely has a significant impact on perceptions of safety that people share with the area.  Furthermore, the trend of violent incidents along the isthmus portrays the area as being an one of understandable concern for individuals given the frequency of violent crime incidents in the area.  When compared side-by-side, these maps raise key questions pertaining to UW-Madison campus safety that I would be interested in pursuing further in a follow up project and that I hope this atlas instils into the thought process of those who frequently traverse the campus and areas around it.  First off, why do perceived safety features abruptly end along the ends of the campus boundary and what more can be done to deter crime and improve overall comfortability in areas near campus where students visit and live?  
					</p>
					<p class="atlasbody">
						Why aren’t more perceived safety features installed along lakeshore pathways that have proven themselves to be areas of great concern in terms of safety and why is there a significant drop in safety features branching out from central campus up toward Picnic Point?  Could the UW-Madison police department draw further collaboration with the Madison police department to lessen the incidence of violent crime along the isthmus and dispel feelings of unease spanning along the extent of State Street?  Is crime on campus a more significant problem than the available data makes it out to be and are there issues of transparency and under-reporting?  As for that final question as a closing thought, when digging through CrimeReports data I found it interesting that the only crimes officially reported on the site between mid-June and December of 2017 were batteries and that only five supposedly occurred on campus within that time frame.  According to the Daily Cardinal, 325 sexual assaults were reported to a campus resource in 2016 (up from 217 in 2015) reinforcing the particular concern of sexual assault on the UW-Madison campus.  And yet, half of the year in 2017 is covered in CrimeReports and not even one instance of crime outside of battery is made visible to the public.  Ultimately, the harsh realities of campus safety leaves me with the difficult question of what isn’t being presented to the public that may shape feelings of safety on campus and skew crime data on the actual safety map in ways I may never fully comprehend.
