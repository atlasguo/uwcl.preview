<p id = 'par'>
In the beginning, there was an enormous drop of milk.  This is how Doondari descended and he created stone.  Stone created iron and iron created fire.  Fire created water and water created air.  Then Doodari came down a second time and he took the five elements.  With them he formed man, but man was proud so Doondari created blindness and blindness overcame man.  But when blindness became too proud, Doondari created sleep and sleep overcame blindness.  But when sleep became too proud Doondari created boredom and boredom overcame sleep.  But when boredom became too proud Doondari created death, and death overcame boredom.  But when death became too proud, Doondari descended for the third time and he came in the guise of Gueno, the Eternal and Gueno overcame death.
