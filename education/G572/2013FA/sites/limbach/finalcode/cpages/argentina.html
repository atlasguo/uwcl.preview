The animals of the forest were arranging a ball and everybody was waiting for that moment, and all the animals had a new dress but the flamingos, which at that time were all white, didn't have anything to wear.  </br></br>


They felt ugly and ridiculous and they didn't like any suit. Desperate, they went to the owl's house who was the most prestigious dressmaker of the forest. She designed for them a pair of striped, white and black trousers. These were the most marvellous suits that a flamingo had ever worn. Now they could go to the party. When the day came everybody was very happy, but the coral snakes were very worried about the flamingo's trousers, because they saw that the trousers were made of snake skin.  </br></br>


The snakes were indignant and they bit the flamingos bodies and legs so they ran to the lake hot and itching.  </br></br>


Since that day they don't go out of the lake because only the water can calm the pain caused by the bites, which left their legs red and their feathers pink like summer dusk.
