</br></br>

Once upon the earth, there were three entities, the Moon, the Sun, and Water.  One day Moon went to visit with his friend, Water.
 
Water said, "Why is it, my friend that so often you have come to visit with me and my people, but, never once, have you invited us to your home?"</br></br>
 
This troubled Moon, even when he returned home.  Moon went home and discussed it with his wife (who was the sun).  Moon asked, "Why is it that so often I have visited with our friend, the Water, but never once, have we invited him here?"
 
She said, "It is because, our home is so humble and so small.  Our home is not large enough to hold Water and all of his family.  We must build a new home, large enough to accommodate all of our friends."
</br></br>
And so, they set about to build a fine and magnificent home, large enough to hold Water and all of his family.
 
When the new home was finished, Moon traveled back to visit Water once again.  This time, Moon extended an invitation to his home.
 
Water accepted the invitation and traveled the long distance to visit the home of the Moon and the Sun. 
 </br></br>
"May I come in?" Water asked when he arrived. 
 
Moon said, "Yes!"
 
Water flowed in the door of the home with all of his plants and all of his fishes, and all of his family, until it reached the height, of a man's knees.
 
Water said again, "May I continue to come in?"
 
Moon again said, "Yes."
 </br></br>
Water continued to flow in the door with all of his plants, and all of his fishes, and all of his people, until it reached the height, of a man's waist.
 
Again, Water asked, "May I continue to come in?"
 
And again Moon said, "Yes!"
 
Water flowed through door with all of his plants, and all of his fishes, and all of his people, until it reached the height, of a man's head.
 
Still the water flowed!  The water flowed, until it reached the roof of the house.  The Water flowed, and the Water flowed, until it pushed Moon and Sun up through the roof of the house.</br></br>
 
Moon and Sun Up got pushed into the first heaven, up into the second heaven, up into the third and highest of heavens.  And that is where they remain today.
 
And that is how the Moon and the Sun came to dwell in the sky and watchdown on the Water of the earth as it flows below them.
