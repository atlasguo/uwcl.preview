	A while back in the former San Jose before automobiles, where ox carts filled the streets and people were simple and superstitious; lived a witch that was in love with the most gallant man in the small village. </br></br>
The man with his great attachment to and belief in the Christian faith wanted nothing to do with her, but the witch using deceptive methods, was able to make him fall in love with her and thus lived with him for much time, converting him to be much the same as her.
Notably, no one approved of this union, much less the village priest whom in his sermons denounced the fact, and in the years that followed, the man no much older was stricken by an incurable illness and requested of the witch that if he should die, that they would give him the official final right in the local temple.
Upon petitioning the priest, the final request of the witche´s beloved, the priest denied the request due to the sins during his lifetime.</br></br>
The witch decided that one way or another she was going to get her husban to that temple, so she put her deceased lovers body in a box and loaded him into the oxcart, she grabbed her broom and machete and proceeded to take him to the temple.
The Oxen moved with great speed, but upon arriving to the entrance of the temple, the priest told them "to stop in the name of the lord", the animals obeyed, but the witch did not as she went on to blasphemy against all that is sacred.</br></br>
The priest forgave the oxen since they complied with his orders, and the witch, the ox cart and the deceased beloved, now walk the earth, and some nights if one listens closely, the sounds of the ox cart’s wheels can be heard passing through the roads of the villages being dragged by furious she devil bare hands.
