Reynard saw that his tale of the three wonderful jewels had awakened interest in the minds of the king and the queen and was very glad, but he was far too cunning to show his pleasure. He kept still a stern, grave face, and after a little silence began to speak again. "Do you still doubt my faith, king?" he said. "Who among all your friends is there who would bring you such precious gifts? My wife wept when she saw me put the jewels in the bag to send to Your Majesty, for, woman-like, she treasured them exceedingly and especially the mirror. Well do I know who has poisoned your heart against me â€“ it is that treacherous thief, Isegrim the Wolf, who has always hated me and would work my ruin if he could!"</br></br>
Isegrim glared at Reynard and showed his teeth in a wicked snarl. If looks could kill, Reynard would have died that day. As it was, however, he took no notice of the wolf's scowls, and went on speaking.
"There was a time, Your Majesty, and not so very long ago, when you knew well how to judge between the wolf and me. Do you remember that day when the wolf and I were in the forest together? We had caught a pig, and were about to make our dinner from it when Your Majesty and Mylady Queen came out of a grove and prayed us to give you a part. You had been out hunting, and had caught nothing, and you were very hungry.
"How did I answer you? 'Yes, lord,' I said, 'with a good will.' But the wolf growled out sulkily like the ill-mannered cur that he is, and took a half of the pig for himself and left only a quarter each for you and the queen. Do you remember? And he gave me only the skinny part of the pig's tail for my dinner. And I was very hungry, lord. Bad luck to him for being such a greedy knave!.</br></br>
"And what was half a pig between you and the queen? You remember how you ate it up quickly and asked for more, and when he neither gave nor offered you any you lifted up your right foot and kicked him till he howled for mercy. Then you said to him, "Make haste and bring us some more food, and we will see that the next meal is shared better.".
"I went with him, and it was not long before we killed a fat calf, and brought it back to you. Then you praised me, and said I was swift in hunting, and bade me deal out the meat. So I dealt it out, saying, 'One half the meat shall be for the king and the other half for the queen. Isegrim shall have the head and I will have the feet.".</br></br>
"Then you said to me, 'Well done, Reynard! Who taught you to share so well?'
"And I answered, 'I learnt it from seeing the sores of Isegrim where you kicked him, my lord. I think his groans at night come from being knocked by Your Majesty.'
"Next you were well pleased and took me into favour, but you sent Isegrim about his business and would have nothing more to do with him. And you were wise in that. This was not the only time that I proved my worth to you in days gone by. I could recall many more things to your mind if it would not take too long. Now, alas, you have forsaken me, who was always your friend, and believe the lies my enemies tell of me."</br></br>
Here Reynard broke down and sobbed, while large tears rolled down his cheeks.
"Come, Reynard," said the king kindly. "Do not give way. I am far from believing everything I hear, you know. As a matter of fact, now I come to think of it, all that I know of Cuwaert's death is the fact that Bellyn brought his head here in a bag. There is no proof that you had anything to do with the killing of him.
