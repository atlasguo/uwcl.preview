	Many years ago lived in the Amazon jungle two passionate lovers who dreamed of getting married, she was called moon and was clothed in silver, and he was called sun and was clothed in gold, moon was the mistress of the night and sun was the owner of the day.
But they had a problem; if they marry, the world would end completely, because ardent love of the sun would end up burning the planet and the sad tears of the moon would end by flood the world.</br></br>
How could they marry despite his love? Does the moon would end the fire?, Does the sun evaporate the water?, For this reason the lovers decided to separate and never marry.
When the sun and moon were separated, the moon cried for a day and night, the tears trickled through the mountains until they reached the sea, but the angry ocean did not want to accept much water. The moon could not mix their tears with the sea and that's when something strange happened. The water produced by the tears of the moon dug an immense valley, then born river, were the tears of the moon that gave life to the Amazon River.</br></br>
