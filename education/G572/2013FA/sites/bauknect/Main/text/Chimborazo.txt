<b>CHIMBORAZO - 6,268 m (20,564 ft)</b><br><br>
Located less than two degrees south of the equator, Chimborazo is a large stratovolcano in the Andes Mountains of South America.  Rising high above the plateau country of Ecuador, this volcano was thought to be the highest mountain in the world from the 1700's until the early 1800's when the Himalaya began to be explored.  In a certain sense however, Chimborazo is the highest point on the Earth.  While the mountain is not the highest mountain above sea level, because it sits on the Earth's equatorial bulge (created by the Earth's rotation), the summit of Chimborazo is the point that is farthest from the center of the Earth.  Chimborazo was first climbed in 1886 and last erupted around the year of 550 AD.
