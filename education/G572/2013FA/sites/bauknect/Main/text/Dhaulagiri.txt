<b>DHAULAGIRI 8,167 m (26,795 ft)</b><br><br>
The Great Trigonometrically Survey of India, started in 1802, was a survey of India performed by the British to map and explore the Indian subcontinent.  In 1808, the survey proclaimed Dhaulagiri to be the highest mountain yet discovered, a title it would hold for the next thirty years.  Dhaulagiri, located in central Nepal, is a dramatic peak.  While it has lost its crown as the highest mountain, Dhaulagiri is almost unrivaled when it comes to how much it's summit rises above its base.  The mountain rises 7,000m above the Khali Gandaki river that curls around its feet.  The name Dhaulagiri in Sanskrit means "Beautiful, white mountain."
