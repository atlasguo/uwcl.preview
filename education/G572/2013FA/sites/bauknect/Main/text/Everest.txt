<b>MOUNT EVEREST 8,848m (29,029 ft)</b><br><br> Known as Chomolungma to the Tibetans to its north and Sagarmatha to the Nepalese to its south, but known to the western world as Mount Everest, this mountain needs little introduction.  It was in 1856 that the Great Trigonometrically Survey of India once and for all declared that they had mathematically proven to have found the highest point above sea level in the world.  Ever since it was named the tallest mountain on Earth, it has attracted mountain climbers from around the world.  In 1953, Tenzig Norgay of Nepal and Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand became the first people to set foot on its summit.
