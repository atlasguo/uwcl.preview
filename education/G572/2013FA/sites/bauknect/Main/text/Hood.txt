<b>MT. HOOD - 3,429 m (11,249 ft)</b><br><br>
Mt. Hood is a large stratovolcano in the Cascade Mountains of North America.  It towers high above the Columbia River and is often seen as a backdrop to the city of Portland, Oregon.  Despite being over just half the elevation of Chimborazo, Mt. Hood had a momentary fling as being claimed to be the Earth's highest point.  In 1792, British Navy Officer George Vancouver, during his exploration of the Pacific Northwest, declared that Mt. Hood soared to over 25,000 ft.  However, further exploration and more detailed surveys would make sure that Mt. Hood would not keep the title for very long.
