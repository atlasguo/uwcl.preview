<b>K2 -  8,611 m (28,251 ft)</b><br><br> Ooops!  For a short time in the 1980's,K2 the world's second highest mountain, was incorrectly measured to have been taller than Mt. Everest. The mountain is a dramatic, steep fang located deep in the icy mountain range of the Karakorum. The Karakoram is a trans-Himalayan range that is just as impressive as its more well known neighbor range of the Himalayas.  K2 is hidden so deep in the range that it did not have a local name, and so it has kept its surveying name (K2 stands for Karakoram - Peak #2) to this day.  In 1986, an incorrect measurement by an expedition climbing the mountain stated that K2 was indeed taller than Mt. Everest.  A corrected measurement was made the next year that returned K2 to the second highest mountain.
