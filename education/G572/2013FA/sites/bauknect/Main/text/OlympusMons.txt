<b>OLYMPUS MONS - 21,229m (69,649 ft)</b><br><br>

While not of this Earth, the summit of Olympus Mons deserves a special mention.  This shield volcano on Mars dwarfs all other mountains in the Solar System.  Due to the weaker gravity on Mars as well as Mars lacking plate tectonics, which on Earth eventually moves a volcano away from its magma source, these have allowed Olympus Mons to grow to gargantuan proportions.  The circumference of the volcano is roughly the same size as the state of Arizona. It is thought to have last erupted roughly two million years ago.
