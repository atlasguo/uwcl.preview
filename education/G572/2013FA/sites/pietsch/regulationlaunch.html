					<h2 style="text-align:center">Mining Regulation in Four Moods</h2><br>
					<p style="text-align:center">Explore a cartographic narrative of Wisconsin's complicated journey into mining regulation. Mining Regulation in Four Moods considers partisanship in the Wisconsin State Legislature, asking if Republicans and Democrats have always held polarized opinions on the issue of the environmental regulation of mining. This slideshow explores this issue by establishing four major periods of legislative action, and declaring a "legislative mood" for each period. Those moods, emerging from the political context of mining in each era, are given context through a text-based narrative, and are displayed graphically through four different styles, each invoking the emotional state of Wisconsin's Legislature for its period.</p>
