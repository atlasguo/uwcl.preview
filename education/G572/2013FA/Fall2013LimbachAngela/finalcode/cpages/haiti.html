Stories are introduced by the invitation to hear a story. The person willing to tell the story shouts out: KRIK. If people want to hear the tale, and they nearly always do, they answer in chorus: KRAK.</br></br>
The most popular folk tales concern the smart, but mischievous Ti Malice and his very slow-witted friend Bouki. In this first issue of tales, I'll just share two very short anecdotal tales.</br></br>
KRIK?</br></br>
KRAK!</br></br>
One day Ti Malice went over to Bouki's house. When he arrived at the lakou (farm yard), was was shocked at what he saw, and watched for some time. Bouki was playing diminoes with his dog! Ti Malice say, "Bouki, what a brilliant dog you have! He can play diminoes." "I don't know,"said Bouki, "he's not so smart. I beat him 3 out of 5 games already!"</br></br>
KRIK?</br></br>
KRAK!</br></br>
Bouki:  "Did I tell you that Madame Joseph had triplets two weeks ago, and now she has twins!"</br></br>
Ti Malice:  "But that's impossible! How can it be?"</br></br>
Bouki:  "One of the triplets is staying at her grandmother's house."
