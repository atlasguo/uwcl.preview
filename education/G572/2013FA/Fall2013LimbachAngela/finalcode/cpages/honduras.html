	It is said that in the enclave of Piedra Blanca, near Trujillo (Atlantic Coast), there was a cave inhabited by a gold lizard who chased cattle. In the cave, which has paintings, strange noises were heard which intimidated the locals. Perhaps the oldest known about this lizard, which is more like a golden crocodile species, is the story that goes back to the early years of the conquest, when Spanish soldiers came up to the present municipality of El Corpus and found huge amounts of gold underground. To facilitate the exploitation of precious ore, they dug a tunnel three miles long. 
The legend goes that one Holy Thursday, the holes reached the exact spot where now stands the high altar of the church, and they discovered a green lagoon. At the bottom moved a huge gold lizard showing its powerful jaws menacing intruders.
