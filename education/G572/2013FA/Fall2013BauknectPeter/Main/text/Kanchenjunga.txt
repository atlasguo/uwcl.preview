<b>KANCHENJUNGA - 8,586 m (28,169 ft)</b><br><br> Called the 'Five Treasures of the Great Snow' after its five summit peaks, Kanchenjunga is a highly sacred summit to the neighboring people of Darjeeling and Sikkim.  In 1847, Kanchenjunga was properly surveyed and at that time, was the highest mountain yet surveyed.  It was recognized as such until 1856, when The Great Trigonometric Survey of India identified Mt. Everest as Earth's high point.  Though it has now lost its crown, Kanchenjunga is still the world's third highest mountain and is the highest point in the country of India.  Despite being climbed by hundreds of climbers, the actual summit of Kanchenjunga has remained un treaded upon, as climbers stop just short of the actual summit out of respect of those who hold the mountain sacred.
