The project covers three separate areas along approximately 1.25 miles of the canyon; Start, Area 2, and Area 3.  All sites have one or more of the following treatments: sediment removal to establish a floodplain, bioengineering to stabilize stream banks, armored resiliency to stabilize stream banks, critical area treatment including willow planting, seeding, mulching and top soiling, and cross vanes. Mature trees and bushes in the existing riparian corridor will be preserved where possible and removed only if absolutely necessary. Trees and bushes removed during the project will be utilized, if possible, onsite within the channel or on the banks for stabilization and/or fish habitat. \nThe focus for the project is not only to repair damage caused by the 2013 flooding, but also to build a more resilient floodplain corridor in order to better protect life, homes and structures in the event of high flows.",

Bank reconstruction and stabilization will consist of a combination of structural (e.g., log and rock toe protection) and bioengineered (e.g., plantings) approaches to help stabilize actively eroding banks and establish a functional channel geometry. Log structures are proposed for armoring the channel banks on the outside of the prominent high energy bend. The channel profile will be graded to target equilibrium slopes and include the establishment of bedforms, including fish-passable steps, pools, and riffles. Extensive floodplain headcutting will be stabilized with grading and revegetation, which will consist of a mix of native riparian and upland species.",

		"Description":"This project seeks to protect property and infrastructure in the vicinity of the SH 60 bridge on the Middle South Platte River. Active streambank erosion will be stabilized through a combination of river training structures and bioengineering bank stabilization. The project seeks to stabilize the stream channel in the vicinity of the bridge and improve sediment and debris transport. Existing cottonwood galleries will be protected by these stabilization measures, and nearbank plantings will increase the stability and habitat value of the reach.",

			Conservation projects are important, but can end up being very costly. Often times, they are not planned well and therefore,
			rack up a lot of unexpected costs that can be easily avoided. This project investigates the cost-effectiveness of Colorado's 
			recent watershed flood recovery projects by calculating the cost per acre seeded. This was determined by the formula: Cost / Acres Seeded. 
			In the near future, I'll work with the Colorado Emergency Watershed Protection Program (EWP) to look into the reason(s)
			for the lack of cost-efficiency with some projects and ensure that they can get the best bang for their bucks.
