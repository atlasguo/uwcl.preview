		<h1>Season 5</h1>
	
	<p>Series creator Chris Carter continues to pen one of the most creative -- and consistent -- shows on television. Throughout season five's 20 thrilling episodes, Agents Mulder and Scully unravel one dark, paranormal mystery after another -- and reveal more about themselves, their pasts and their fears. Of course, it wouldn't be the X-Files without a healthy dose of conspiracy in each episode.
