		<h1>Season 6</h1>
		
		<p>It seems that these two FBI agents have no choice but to fight the future. Dana Scully and Fox Mulder continue to investigate eerie, unexplained phenomena in season six of the landmark Fox Network series. Cover-ups abound as the indomitable duo sleuth their way through conspiratorial webs that lead straight to the top and to people who seem to want the agents to stop succeeding -- at any cost.</p>
