<h1>The Story of Wisconsin's Beloved Farmers</h1>
	<div id = "intro1">
	<p> In the past, producing one's food was a necessity of life. This simple notion bound people intimately to their land, food, and neighbors.</p> <p>Wisconsin is traditionally known for its deep-rooted dairy farming background. This can be attributed to the rich ecological history of the state.</p><p> Wisconsin agriculture is so much more than a resource, though. It is a landscape of interaction and connectedness. </p></div>
	
	<div id = "intro2"> 
	<p>Today, many of the traditional connections with land and food have become strained.</p><p>Fortunately, the Dane County Farmers Market in Madison, Wisconsin serves as an outlet for the community to engage in local food culture and learn about where their food comes from.</p> <p>At market, relationships form between producers and consumers through conversations that would otherwise never take place.</p> </div>
