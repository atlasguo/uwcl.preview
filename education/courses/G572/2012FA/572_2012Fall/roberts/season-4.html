		<h1>Season 4</h1>
		
		<p>The conspiracies continue to deepen, with original storylines just as sharp and intriguing as the three previous seasons. Join FBI agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully as they tackle the mysterious and the paranormal among us. Nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted, sometimes not even each other, when they face the dark mysteries of the universe.
