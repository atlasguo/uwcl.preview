<h3 id = 'head'>What King Solomon Learned from Beasts</h3>
</br></br>
<p id = 'par'>
King Solomon, the wisest of men, knew the languages of beasts and often conversed with them.  His philosophy, which may at times seem cynical to some of us, perhaps owes as much to what he thus learned from beasts as to what he learned from observing men.
Among his other writings, King Solomon left to posterity a manuscript in which he taught us the languages of beasts.  Unfortunately, this priceless work was lost beneath the ruins of the Temple of Jerusalem at the time of its destruction.  The few who had been privileged to study this book, the only one of its kind, have piously handed down to us some of its contents by word of mouth, from generation to generation through the centuries.  Colorful fables illustrate many of the more scientific elements of this ancient tradition. </br></br>
Cat and dog, clean and unclean:  If your dog touches your food, let him take it: his mouth is unclean.  If your cat touches your food, share it with him: his mouth is clean.
The Flounder: Moses stretched out his arm over the sea and the Lord turned back the waters with a great wind from the East.  He dried the sea and the waters were parted. This is what is written in the Torah.  While the Lord was thus dividing for our forefathers the waters of the sea, some of its fish were split in two halves, and thus became flounders. </br></br>
Talismans: In order to protect your family and your goods from the wiles of the Evil Eye, you should hang on your wall, by the entrance to your home, one of the following talismans, which have all been tested and proven:  The bone of the brow of an ox, with both of its horns, in order to pierce the eyes of all those who wish you ill or are envious of you, the tail of a tuna-fish, two egg-shells, the tusk of a wild boar, a horse-shoe, or else, better still, a sea-horse, or a starfish.  In order that your new home bring you luck, before your own feet or those of any of your family cross its threshold, raise the stone of your doorstep and bury beneath it, very deep, a fish that bears scales, preferably a sea-bream.  After that, you can put your doorstep back where it belongs and cement it securely.
