	Long ago, in the lush forests of Guatemala, where jaguars and serpents served as guardians of the bush, the humans who lived there were in harmony with the Earth, just as the gods had intended.
One day, a son was born to the chief of one of the forest tribes, and his parents named the boy Quetzal. On that very day, just after the child was born, a hummingbird landed on a tree before the chief's home.</br></br>
This was no ordinary hummingbird. It was larger than most and brilliantly colored, and the chief was certain this must be a sign. He called the wise men of his tribe to tell him the meaning, for in those days everyone believed that each person had a spirit and creature companion.
The wise men told the chief that the appearance of the hummingbird meant that one day Quetzal would become a beloved chief. And, they said, there was something more.
"What else?" the chief asked.
The wise men shook their heads. "His future is unusual, but we cannot tell the whole story until he is older."</br></br>
The chief was pleased to hear his son would be beloved, and he never noticed the way his brother, Chiruma, looked at Quetzal with jealousy. Each day Chiruma grew more jealous of his nephew. Chiruma longed to become chief of the tribe; he did not want Quetzal to take his rightful place.</br></br>
Time passed, and Quetzal grew to be exactly as the wise men had foretold. He was strong and courageous, a fine hunter and fisherman, kind and generous as well. One day, it was clear, he would be a great leader.
Alas, one morning when he was still a young man, Quetzal called to his father to attend a meeting of the tribe. When his father did not respond, the young man went to find him and discovered to his deep sadness that his father had died in his sleep.
Everyone offered kind words to Quetzal, whose heart was broken, and when the days of mourning had ended, the wise men gathered and announced that Quetzal would be their new chief.</br></br>
The wise men had this to add: "The sign of the hummingbird means this our chief Quetzal will never die. The gods have chosen him to be immortal."
The people were overjoyed at this news. They shouted their thanks to the gods as they celebrated. All that night they sang and danced and feasted, and so busy were they enjoying their great fortune that no one noticed the angry Chiruma, who sat in a corner plotting his revenge.</br></br>
Not long after this, a neighboring tribe attacked, and Chiruma, seizing the opportunity, called upon his nephew to lead the others to battle.
Quetzal did not hesitate. He marched ahead of his warriors, and the enemies' arrows flew toward him. But before they reached his body, they simply arced and fell to the ground. When the enemy saw this, they fled in terror.
So it was true, the young man was protected by the gods. Chiruma's hatred of Quetzal deepened, and he pondered what strategy he must now employ.</br></br>
Chiruma determined that Quetzal's protection must come from the charm he wore around his neck. One night he stole quietly into the young man's dwelling. Barely breathing, he lifted the blanket and saw the charm, a cord with a tiny hummingbird feather. Chiruma carefully cut the cord, took the feather and stole silently from the room.</br></br>
The next morning, never noticing his feather was gone, Quetzal walked into the forest to hunt. When he heard a rustling of leaves behind him, he turned to see what creature might be there, but it was no animal. Instead, there stood his uncle, and Quetzal only heard the arrow as it whistled toward him. He felt the sting as it pierced his chest.</br></br>
Quetzal collapsed and fell to the ground, and as he did he pulled the arrow from his chest. Desperately he tried to stop the flow of blood, but the flood was too great. Lying on the forest floor, Quetzal felt life ebbing from his body â€” but then, before his uncle's eyes, a miraculous thing happened. The young man transformed: His skin turned to feathers the color of blood and of the brilliant plants surrounding him. His arms became wings, and on his head there was a crown of green bristles. A yellow bill gleamed, bright eyes flashed, and the magnificent bird rose gracefully into the air.</br></br>
The people say the gods always have their way, and they kept their promise to Quetzal. The hummingbird feather did not protect Chiruma, but the gods forever protected Quetzal. This brilliant bird, the most beautiful creature in the forest, lives still in the forests of Guatemala. The people call the Quetzal their holy bird, and when the people see it in glorious flight, their leader lives on in their hearts and memories.
