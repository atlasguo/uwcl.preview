<b>NANDA DEVI - 7,816 m (25,643 ft)</b><br><br>
The colonization of India by the British would open up the Himalaya and surrounding mountains to the western world.  The mountain Nanda Devi, whose name translates into Bliss Giving Goddess, is often seen as one of the most beautiful mountains in the world.  Nanda Devi was the highest mountain that was ever directly controlled by the British (both the British East India Company and later the British Raj), so prior to the Great Trigonometrically Survey of India and later exploration, it was believed to be the highest mountain in the world.
